# Configuration within Discord

## Requirements

- Enable SnailyCAD API Token in CAD-Settings
- Enable "User API Token"'s feature in CAD-Settings

## Getting Started

In Discord, go to the server where the bot needs to be configured.

### 1. Set the CAD's API configuration

To set the API configuration so the bot knows what URL to use and what token to use, use the following command in Discord:
Enter both the API Token and API URL.

```
/config set <...>
```

### 2. Set the user configuration

To allow the bot to use the user's API token, use the following command in Discord:

:::info
Each user that wants to use the bot's features that require the personal API Token, must first use this command.
:::

```
/user-config set <...>
```

### 3. Start using the bot

Use `/help` to see the available commands.
