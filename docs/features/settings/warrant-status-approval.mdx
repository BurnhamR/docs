# Warrant Status Approval

When an officer with the `Manage Warrants` permission creates an `Active Warrant`,
that warrant must first be approved by a user with the `Manange Pending Warrants` permission.

Once the warrant has been approved it will be [displayed on the Officers Dashboard](/docs/features/settings/active-warrants)
