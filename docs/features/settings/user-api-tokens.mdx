# User API Tokens

This allows users to generate their own API token to perform actions on their behalf.
This is useful for users who want to use the API to perform actions for creating personal external integrations.

:::tip

There is also a permission available for this: `Use Personal Api Token`.
This permissions can be revoked from users who should not be able to generate their own API token.

:::

The token must first be enabled and generated by the user.
