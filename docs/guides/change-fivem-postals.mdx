# How to change the pre-defined postals

In the FiveM integrations, there are pre-defined postals stored in a `.json` file. You're able to change these soonâ„¢.

## Steps

:::caution

The `sna-postals` resource **must** be named **`sna-postals`**. It will use default postals if it's not named correctly.

:::

1. Download [`sna-postals` from the latest release](https://github.com/SnailyCAD/fivem-integrations/releases)
2. Extract the zip folder into your `resources` folder (**Folder must be named: `sna-postals`**)
3. Add `ensure sna-postals` to your `server.cfg` file
4. Edit the `postals.json` file in the `sna-postals` folder to fit your needs
5. Restart your server
