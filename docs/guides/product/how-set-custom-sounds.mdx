# How to set custom sounds

In this guide, you will learn how to manage custom sounds for your SnailyCAD instance.
All sound files are stored locally in the CAD, this allows you to change the sounds to your liking.

:::info

SnailyCADv4 currently supports the following actions that are connected to a sound:

| Action           | Sound (filename)       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Panic Button     | `panic-button.mp3`     |
| Signal 100       | `signal100.mp3`        |
| Added to call    | `added-to-call.mp3`    |
| Roleplay stopped | `roleplay-stopped.mp3` |
| Status Update    | `status-update.mp3`    |
| Incoming Call    | `incoming-call.mp3`    |
| LEO Tone         | `leo-tone.mp3`         |
| EMS/FD Tone      | `ems-fd-tone.mp3`      |

## How to change these files

### 1. Stop your SnailyCAD instance

Before we can manage any custom sounds, we must first stop SnailyCAD.

:::info

Make sure you are in the same directory as your SnailyCAD instance.

:::

<Tabs groupId="installation-method">
  <TabItem value="standalone" label="Standalone" default>

If you are running SnailyCAD standalone, you can simply press `CTRL+C` in the terminal window where SnailyCAD is running.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

If you are running SnailyCAD with Docker, you can stop SnailyCAD by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f production.docker-compose.yml down
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Open your SnailyCAD sounds directory

The sounds directory can be found at: `apps/client/public/sounds`

### 3. Replace the files

Here you can replace, add or remove sound files. You will notice, not all sounds are present in the directory. This is because only a few are provided by default.

:::caution
**Your custom sound files must match the filenames listed above and must have `.mp3` extensions**
:::

### 4. Rebuild your SnailyCAD instance

<Tabs groupId="installation-method">
  <TabItem value="standalone" label="Standalone" default>

If you are running SnailyCAD standalone, you can run the following command to rebuild the client:

```bash
yarn turbo run build --filter="{packages/**/**}" && yarn turbo run build --filter="{apps/**/**}"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

If you are running SnailyCAD with Docker, you can run the following command to rebuild the client:

```bash
docker-compose -f production.docker-compose.yml build
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 5. Start your SnailyCAD instance

<Tabs groupId="installation-method">
  <TabItem value="standalone" label="Standalone" default>
If you are running SnailyCAD standalone, you can run the following command to start SnailyCAD:

```bash
yarn run concurrently "yarn workspace @snailycad/client start" "yarn workspace @snailycad/api generate && yarn workspace @snailycad/api start"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">
If you are running SnailyCAD with Docker, you can run the following command to start SnailyCAD:

```bash
docker-compose -f production.docker-compose.yml up -d
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
