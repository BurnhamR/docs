# How to translate SnailyCADv4

In this guide you will learn how to use an existing locale or how to add a new custom locale.

## Adding a new custom locale

To add a custom locale, there are a few steps required.

1. Open the following directory: `apps/client/locales`
2. Duplicate the **`en`** folder and rename to a correct [locale code](https://github.com/meikidd/iso-639-1/blob/master/src/data.js)
3. Start editing the `.json` files in the **newly duplicated** folder.
4. Once finished, add your locale to `i18n.config.mjs`:

```js
// apps/client/i18n.config.mjs
export const i18n = {
  locales: [, /* the previous locales */ "YOUR_LOCALE_HERE"],
  defaultLocale: "YOUR_LOCALE_HERE", // replace this with your locale
};
```

## Using an existing locale as default locale

To use an existing locale, you need to set as default in `i18n.config.mjs`:

:::tip
Users can also set their own locale for their CAD account separately.
:::

```js
// apps/client/i18n.config.mjs
export const i18n = {
  locales: ["en" /* other locales might be here */],
  defaultLocale: "en", // replace en with the locale above to corresponds with your language
};
```

Restarting the client will now set the default locale to the locale you set.
