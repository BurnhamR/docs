Your API and client must both be either on `https://` or `http://`. **It cannot be mixed**

## .env file conflicts

This is just a warning that can be ignored.

## "P1000: Authentication Faild against database ..."

![invalid_db_creds](/invalid_db_creds.png)

Make your credentials are correct to the database. The default username for PostgreSQL is `postgres`.

If you installed `PgAdmin`, it should've asked to enter a password, you must enter the same password in your .env file.
