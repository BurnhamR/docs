# How to set custom sounds

SnailyCADv4 currently supports several different types for audio:

- Panic Button (`panic-button.mp3`)
- Signal 100 (`signal-100.mp3`)
- Added to call (`added-to-call.mp3`)
- Roleplay stopped (`roleplay-stopped.mp3`)

There are files stored in the CAD that can be changed to custom sounds for your community.

## How to change these files

1. Open `packages/client/public/sounds`
2. Overwrite the wanted files.

:::caution
**Your custom sound files must match the filenames listed above and must have `.mp3` extensions**
:::

3. Rebuild the client: `yarn workspace @snailycad/client build`
4. Restart the CAD
