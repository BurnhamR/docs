# Autoinstaller

This guide explains how to setup SnailyCADv4 **with an automated installer process**

## Requirements

All the items listed below are required to get the CAD up and running smoothly.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **(16.6+ is required.)** ([Video Guide](https://youtu.be/rp308wNdXU8))
- [yarn](https://npmjs.com/package/yarn) **(`npm install --global yarn`)** ([Video Guide](https://youtu.be/rp308wNdXU8))
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) **(version 14 or higher)** ([Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKWZvafvqwM))

## Installing the CAD

Once you've got all the items installed, we can get started with installing SnailyCADv4.

### Getting Started

To get started, open the Command Prompt on Windows or the Terminal on Linux.

Once it has opened, run the following commands. This will automatically run the commands of the [Standalone installation](/docs/installations/methods/standalone) and will ask questions where needed.

_`curl` is supported on all operating systems._

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SnailyCAD/autoinstaller/main/dist/index.js > script.js

node script.js
```

### Starting SnailyCAD

After completing all the steps above, we are ready to startup the CAD. To do this run the following command:

```bash
yarn run concurrently "yarn workspace @snailycad/client start" "yarn workspace @snailycad/api generate && yarn workspace @snailycad/api start"
```

### Accesing SnailyCADv4

You can open SnailyCADv4 via a web browser, on your [LAN IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network) and the `PORT_CLIENT`, example: `http://192.168.92.20:3000`

SnailyCADv4 also supports domains, [WAN IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network), etc.

:::info
The ports `3000` and `8080` **must be forwarded** in your firewall if you're **not** using some proxy.
