# Autoinstaller

This guide explains how to setup SnailyCADv4 **with an automated installer process**

## Requirements

All the items listed below are required to get the CAD up and running smoothly.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **(16.6+ is required.)** ([Video Guide](https://youtu.be/rp308wNdXU8))
- [yarn](https://npmjs.com/package/yarn) **(`npm install --global yarn`)** ([Video Guide](https://youtu.be/rp308wNdXU8))
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) **(version 14 or higher)** ([Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKWZvafvqwM))

## Getting Started

Once you've got all the items installed, we can get started with installing SnailyCADv4.
Open the Command Prompt on Windows or the Terminal on Linux.

Now run the commands seen bellow. This will automatically run the commands of the [Standalone installation](/docs/installations/methods/standalone) and will ask questions where needed.

_`curl` is supported on all operating systems._

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SnailyCAD/autoinstaller/main/dist/index.js > script.js

node script.js
```

### Starting SnailyCAD

After completing all the steps above, we are ready to startup the CAD. To do this run the following command:

```bash
yarn run concurrently "yarn workspace @snailycad/client start" "yarn workspace @snailycad/api generate && yarn workspace @snailycad/api start"
```

### 6. Accessing SnailyCADv4

By default, you can access SnailyCADv4 via a web browser on your [LAN IP](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-local-ip-address) and the `PORT_CLIENT`, example: `http://192.168.92.20:3000`

You can also connect SnailyCADv4 to a domain via a proxy such as [NGINX](https://nginx.org) or [Apache](https://apache.org)

:::info
The ports set for the client and API **must be forwarded** in your firewall if you're **not** using some proxy.

By default:

- Client port: `3000`
- API port: `8080`

:::caution
Do **not** use `localhost` for Accessing SnailyCAD. It will not work!
