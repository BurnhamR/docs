# Docker Installation

## Requirements

All the items listed below are required to get the CAD up and running smoothly.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **(16.6+ is required.)** ([Video Guide](https://youtu.be/rp308wNdXU8))
- [yarn](https://npmjs.com/package/yarn) **(`npm install --global yarn`)** ([Video Guide](https://youtu.be/rp308wNdXU8))
- [Docker Desktop](https://docker.com/get-started) (Windows), [Docker](https://docker.com/get-started) (Linux)

## Getting Started

Once you've got all the items installed, we can get started with installing SnailyCADv4.
Open the Command Prompt on Windows or the Terminal on Linux.

### 1. Cloning the GitHub repository

:::caution

<span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Warning:</span> Do not install SnailyCADv4 in the root folder. Install
it in your <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Documents </span>
folder on Windows or <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>home</span> folder on Linux.

To fix this, run the following command:

**Windows**

```bash
cd Documents
```

**Linux**

```bash
cd /home/$(whoami)
```

:::

Firstly, we need to clone the GitHub repository to our local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnailyCAD/snaily-cadv4.git
```

Once the files have been cloned from GitHub, we can enter that folder:

```bash
cd snaily-cadv4
```

### 2. Installing dependencies

Now we will install the dependencies that are required for SnailyCADv4 to function properly.

```bash
yarn
```

### 3. Configuration

Configuration can be a bit complicated, so pay close attention. The following steps will help you configure SnailyCADv4's environment variables.
These variables are used by SnailyCADv4 to connect to the database and store special tokens used for SnailyCAD's features.
_**Tip:** In support channels, this will be referenced as the `.env` file._

We must first copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

**Windows:**

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

**Linux:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

<img src="/gifs/move-env.gif" alt="Move env short clip" loading="lazy" width="600px" />

Now we can start configuring the variables in the `.env` file. See next step [3.1 .env file](#31-env-info).

#### 3.1 .env info

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The password to the PostgreSQL database.
- `POSTGRES_USER`: The username to the PostgreSQL database.
- `DB_HOST`: The database host. _Most likely `localhost`_
- `DB_PORT`: The port to the database.
- `POSTGRES_DB`: The database name.
- `JWT_SECRET`: This is a random value to keep the CAD secured.
- `CORS_ORIGIN_URL`: The URL/IP to where the CAD is hosted at, e.g., `https://cad.mysite.com` or `http://99.99.00.190:3000`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_ORIGIN`: The URL/IP to where the API is hosted at, e.g., `https://cad-api.mysite.com/v1` or `http://99.99.00.190:8000/v1`.
- `PORT_API`: The port where the API should run on. _(Default 8080)_
- `PORT_CLIENT`: The port where the client should run on. _(Default: 3000)_
- `ENCRYPTION_TOKEN`: Used to generate encrypted values. **Must be 32 characters long**
- `DATABASE_URL`: **Do not change unless you know what you're doing!**

#### 3.2 Docker network

Now we must setup a Docker network so the CAD can communicate with it's services.

```
docker network create cad_web
```

### 4. Building everything

Now we must build all the packages again. _(client, schemas, config, types)_

```bash
yarn turbo run build
```

### 5. Starting SnailyCADv4

After completing all the steps above, we are ready to startup the CAD. To do this run the following command:

_**Note:** When running the command for the fist time, this will
pull down all services from the Docker Hub. This can take a few minutes._

```bash
docker-compose -f production.docker-compose.yml up -d
```

#### 5.1 Tips

- To stop SnailyCADv4, enter `docker-compose down` in a command prompt/terminal in the directory where you installed the CAD and wait for the services to stop.
- To view Docker's logs for SnailyCAdv4, enter `docker-compose logs` in a command prompt/terminal in the directory where you installed the CAD.


### 6. Accessing SnailyCADv4

You can open SnailyCADv4 via a web browser, on your [LAN IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network) and the `PORT_CLIENT`, example: `http://192.168.92.20:3000`

SnailyCADv4 also supports domains, [WAN IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network), etc.

:::info
The ports `3000` and `8080` **must be forwarded** in your firewall if you're **not** using some proxy.
:::

:::caution
Do **not** use `localhost` for Accessing SnailyCAD. It will not work!
