# Standalone installation

This guide explains how to setup SnailyCADv4 **without Docker**.

You can also find [a video version](https://youtu.be/06NiiO8-rIM) of this guide.

## Requirements

All the items listed below are required to get SnailyCADv4 up and running smoothly.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **(16.6+ is required.)** ([Video Guide](https://youtu.be/rp308wNdXU8))
- [yarn](https://npmjs.com/package/yarn) **(`npm install --global yarn`)** ([Video Guide](https://youtu.be/rp308wNdXU8))
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) **(version 14 or higher)** ([Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKWZvafvqwM))

## Getting Started

Once you've got all the items installed, we can get started with installing SnailyCADv4.
Open the Command Prompt on Windows or the Terminal on Linux.

### 1. Cloning the GitHub repository

:::caution

<span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Warning:</span> Do not install SnailyCADv4 in the root folder. Install
it in your <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Documents </span>
folder on Windows or <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>home</span> folder on Linux.

To fix this, run the following command:

**Windows**

```bash
cd Documents
```

**Linux**

```bash
cd /home/$(whoami)
```

:::

Firstly, we need to clone the GitHub repository to our local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnailyCAD/snaily-cadv4.git
```

<img src="/gifs/git-clone.gif" alt="Git clone short clip" loading="lazy" width="600px" />

Once the files have been cloned from GitHub, we can enter that folder:

```bash
cd snaily-cadv4
```

<img src="/gifs/cd.gif" alt="Change directory short clip" loading="lazy" width="600px" />

### 2. Installing dependencies

Now we will install the dependencies that are required for SnailyCADv4 to function properly.

```bash
yarn
```

<img src="/gifs/yarn.gif" alt="yarn install short clip" loading="lazy" width="600px" />

### 3. Configuration

Configuration can be a bit complicated, so pay close attention. The following steps will help you configure SnailyCADv4's environment variables.
These variables are used by SnailyCADv4 to connect to the database and store special tokens used for SnailyCAD's features.
_**Tip:** In support channels, this will be referenced as the `.env` file._

We must first copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

**Windows:**

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

**Linux:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

<img src="/gifs/move-env.gif" alt="Move env short clip" loading="lazy" width="600px" />

Now we can start configuring the variables in the `.env` file. See next step [3.1 .env file](#31-env-info).

#### 3.1 .env info

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The password to the PostgreSQL database.
- `POSTGRES_USER`: The username to the PostgreSQL database.
- `DB_HOST`: The database host. _Most likely `localhost`_
- `DB_PORT`: The port to the database.
- `POSTGRES_DB`: The database name.
- `JWT_SECRET`: This is a random value to keep the CAD secured.
- `CORS_ORIGIN_URL`: The URL/IP to where the CAD is hosted at, e.g., `https://cad.mysite.com` or `http://99.99.00.190:3000`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_ORIGIN`: The URL/IP to where the API is hosted at, e.g., `https://cad-api.mysite.com/v1` or `http://99.99.00.190:8000/v1`.
- `PORT_API`: The port where the API should run on. _(Default 8080)_
- `PORT_CLIENT`: The port where the client should run on. _(Default: 3000)_
- `ENCRYPTION_TOKEN`: Used to generate encrypted values. **Must be 32 characters long**
- `DATABASE_URL`: **Do not change unless you know what you're doing!**

#### 3.2 Moving env file

Once you've **correctly configured all the variables**, we must copy the `.env` file to the client and API:

**Windows/Linux:**

```bash
node scripts/copy-env.mjs --client --api
```

<img src="/gifs/copy-env.gif" alt="copy env short clip" loading="lazy" width="600px" />

:::caution
**WARNING:** Please, do not edit `packages/client/.env` or `packages/api/.env` directly. Always edit the root `.env` file.

When changing something in the `.env` file after the installation process, make sure to run the following steps:

1. `node scripts/copy-env.mjs --client --api`
2. `yarn workspace @snailycad/client build`

[Read more here](/docs/guides/how-to-properly-update-env)

:::

### 4. Building everything

Now we must build all the packages. _(client, schemas, config, types)_

_**Note:** this process might take 2 to 5minutes_

```bash
yarn turbo run build
```

<img src="/gifs/turbo-build.gif" alt="turbo build short clip" loading="lazy" width="600px" />

### 5. Starting SnailyCADv4

After completing all the steps above, we are ready to startup the CAD. To do this run the following command:

```bash
yarn run concurrently "yarn workspace @snailycad/client start" "yarn workspace @snailycad/api generate && yarn workspace @snailycad/api start"
```

### 6. Accessing SnailyCADv4

You can open SnailyCADv4 via a web browser, on your [LAN IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network) and the `PORT_CLIENT`, example: `http://192.168.92.20:3000`

SnailyCADv4 also supports domains, [WAN IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network), etc.

:::info
The ports `3000` and `8080` **must be forwarded** in your firewall if you're **not** using some proxy.
:::

:::caution
Do **not** use `localhost` for Accessing SnailyCAD. It will not work!
