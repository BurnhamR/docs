# NGINX Reverse proxy guide for Windows

:::caution
This guide is targetted for Windows users. [A Linux based guide can be found here](/)
:::

:::note
This guide does not yet include SSL setup due to complexity. For now, I recommend you take a look at [win-acme](https://win-acme.com) for generating SSL certificates.
:::

## Terminology

- **API**: The API of SnailyCAD - the backend.
- **Client**: The client (UI) of SnailyCAD - the frontend.
- **NGINX**: NGINX is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.

## 1. Installation

### 1.1. Installing NGINX

First, we need to install NGINX. [Download the latest release here](https://nginx.org/en/download.html)

{/* todo: image */}
[NGINX Windows Download](/nginx-windows/nginx-download)

### 1.2. Extract NGINX download

Once you have downloaded the NGINX archive, you must extract it to `C:\nginx`.

{/* todo: image */}
[NGINX Extract](/nginx-windows/nginx-extract)

## 2. Starting NGINX

To start NGINX you must open a command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
cd C:\nginx
start nginx.exe
```

If you have done everything correctly, you should be able to access the NGINX welcome page at <http://localhost>.

:::tip
Keep this command prompt open. You will need to run some more commands in this command prompt.
:::

## 3. Configuring NGINX

### 3.1. Setting `server_names_hash_bucket_size`

To allow for longer domain names, we must set this value to `64`. Open the `C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf` file and add the following code to the `http` block:

```bash
http {
  # ...
  server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
  # ...
}
```

:::tip
A full example of the `nginx.conf` file can be found further down this page.
:::

### 3.2. Configuring the API

First, we need to configure the API. Open the `C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf` file and add the following code to the `http` block:

```bash
http {
  # ...

  # SnailyCAD API Reverse Proxy
  server {
    # Replace `example.com` with your domain name.
    server_name cad-api.example.com;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; # The API port of SnailyCAD's API (Default: 8080)
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }


    # Security headers
    add_header X-XSS-Protection          "1; mode=block" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options    "nosniff" always;
    add_header Referrer-Policy           "no-referrer" always;
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
    add_header X-DNS-Prefetch-Control on;
    add_header Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy "same-site";

    # keep this as-is unless you know what you're doing.
    listen 80;
  }

  #...
}
```

:::tip
A full example of the `nginx.conf` file can be found further down this page.
:::

### 3.3. Configuring the client

Once the API is configured, we must add the client block. Open the `C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf` file and add the following code to the `http` block:

```bash

http {
  # ...

  # SnailyCAD Client Reverse Proxy
  server {
    # Replace `example.com` with your domain name.
    server_name cad.example.com;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; # The API port of SnailyCAD's client (Default: 3000)
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }


    # Security headers
    add_header X-XSS-Protection          "1; mode=block" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options    "nosniff" always;
    add_header Referrer-Policy           "no-referrer" always;
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
    add_header X-DNS-Prefetch-Control on;
    add_header Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy "same-site";

    # keep this as-is unless you know what you're doing.
    # for SSL, see step 6
    listen 80;
  }

  # ...
}
```

      add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
      add_header X-DNS-Prefetch-Control on;
      add_header Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy "same-site";

      # keep this as-is unless you know what you're doing.
      listen 80;
    }

    server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  localhost;

        location / {
            root   html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }

        error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
            root   html;
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

### 2.3 Verify NGINX configuration

To verify the NGINX configuration, run the following command:

```bash
nginx -t
```

If the configuration is valid, you should see the following output:

```bash
nginx: the configuration file C:\nginx/conf/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file C:\nginx/conf/nginx.conf test is successful
```

### 3. Restarting NGINX

To restart NGINX, run the following command:

```bash
nginx -s reload
```

:::tip
This command must be run every time you make changes to the `nginx.conf` file in the `C:\nginx` directory.
:::

## 4. Updating SnailyCAD configuration

You must now update the SnailyCAD configuration to use the SSL certificate. To do this, open the SnailyCAD `.env` file:

```bash
# This is the URL to your site where the CAD is hosted.
CORS_ORIGIN_URL="http://cad.example.com"

# This is the URL to your site where the CAD is hosted.
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL="http://cad.example.com"

# The URL to where the API is hosted.
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_ORIGIN="http://cad-api.example.com/v1"

# The domain of your site. Without any subdomains or paths.
DOMAIN="example.com"
```

:::tip
Replace `example.com` with your domain name.
:::

:::tip
You can now access SnailyCAD via `http://cad.example.com` with the API accessible via `http://cad-api.example.com`.
