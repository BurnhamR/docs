# Standalone

Find out how to update SnailyCADv4 manually when using the standalone installation method.

### Getting started

First, shut down your SnailyCAD instance:

<Tabs groupId="running-method">
  <TabItem value="terminal" label="Terminal/Command Prompt" default>
If you are running SnailyCAD in the foreground in a Terminal or Command Prompt. Simply press `CTRL + C` to stop your SnailyCAD instance.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pm2" label="pm2">
If you are running SnailyCAD with Docker, you can run the following command to start SnailyCAD:

```bash
pm2 stop all
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 1. Update local code

First we must update our local code:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

:::caution
If you encounter any merge conflicts, please resolve them before continuing.

This can be done by backing up any locale changes you've made including `apps/client/i18n.config.mjs`. Then you can safely run the following command:

```bash
git stash && git pull origin main
```

### 2. Update dependencies

Secondly, we must update dependencies that might've changes from the last release. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
yarn
```

### 3. Configuration

If there's something that needs to be changed in the .env file, make sure to do that properly. [View the guide here](/docs/guides/env/how-to-properly-update-env)

### 4. Rebuild everything

Now we must build all the packages & apps again. _(client, schemas, config, types)_

```bash
yarn turbo run build --filter="{packages/**/**}" && yarn turbo run build --filter="{apps/**/**}"
```

### 5. Start SnailyCAD

To bring the CAD back up run the following command:

```bash
yarn run concurrently "yarn workspace @snailycad/client start" "yarn workspace @snailycad/api generate && yarn workspace @snailycad/api start"
```
