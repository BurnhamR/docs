# How to set custom map files

If your community uses a different map you are able to change this. There is some setup required for this.

## Requirements

- Map tiles, must be the following format:
  - `minimap_sea_0_0.webp`
  - `minimap_sea_0_1.webp`
  - `minimap_sea_1_0.webp`
  - `minimap_sea_1_1.webp`
  - `minimap_sea_2_0.webp`
  - `minimap_sea_2_1.webp`

## Steps

1. Get your map tiles ready. (See requirements)
2. Head to the `<CAD-Root>/apps/client/public/tiles`.
3. Replace the default map tiles with your map files.
4. Rebuild the client: `yarn turbo run build`
5. Restart the CAD
