## Possible ways to fix it

You're getting an error message stating `An unknown error occurred` once you try register for the first time. This should be a simple fix!
Verify with the steps below that you've setup everything correctly.

- Is the API online and able to accept connections?
  - Yes:
    - Make sure you entered the correct IP/domain of where your API is hosted at.
    - Make sure that you've correctly entered the `CORS_ORIGIN_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_ORIGIN` in the `.env` file.
  - No:
    - Make sure there are no errors on startup
    - Make sure the required ports are forwared (`8080` and `3000`)
    - Make sure you've setup your IP/domain correctly in the `.env` file.
