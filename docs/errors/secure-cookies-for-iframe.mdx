# Unable to enable SECURE_COOKIES_FOR_IFRAME

This error will appear if you try to enable `SECURE_COOKIES_FOR_IFRAME` in the `.env` file but your SnailyCAD instance is not using HTTPS.

```
Secure cookies (SECURE_COOKIES_FOR_IFRAME) could not be enabled because this SnailyCAD instance is not using HTTPS.
```

## Possible ways to fix it

- Enable HTTPS on your SnailyCAD instance (Proxy, Cloudflare, etc.)
- Disable `SECURE_COOKIES_FOR_IFRAME` in the `.env` file when not using HTTPS
