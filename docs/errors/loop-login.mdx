# Looped Login page

This error can be described as following: you login or create an account,
it successfully creates the cookie and account but it will instantly kick you back to the login page.

## Possible ways to fix it

- Use correct ENV/.env file configurtion
  - You cannot use `SECURE_COOKIES_FOR_IFRAME` without a domain **and** SSL/https
  - You cannot use `DOMAIN` when `CORS_ORIGIN_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_ORIGIN` are not that domain.
- Incorrect DNS configurtion
- **last resort:** send a message in the support channel with the things you've tried and include your ENV/.env file
