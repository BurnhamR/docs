# Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address in use

This means the port SnailyCAD requires is already in-use. This should be a simple fix.

## Possible ways to fix it

- Verify there are no other programs/processes running on this port.
- Restart your VPS/PC
- Kill the process via: `npx kill-port <port-here>`
