# Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address in use

This means the port SnailyCAD requires is already in-use. This should be a simple fix.

## Example Error

```bash
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use 0.0.0.0:3000
at Server.setupListenHandle [as _listen2] (node:net:1372:16)
at listenInCluster (node:net:1420:12)
at doListen (node:net:1559:7)
at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:84:21) {
  code: 'EADDRINUSE',
  errno: -4091,
  syscall: 'listen',
  address: '0.0.0.0',
  port: 3000
}
```

## Possible ways to fix it

- Verify there are no other programs/processes running on this port.
- Restart your VPS/PC
- Kill the process via: `npx kill-port <port-here>`
