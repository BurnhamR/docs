![invalid_db_creds](/invalid_db_creds.png)

Make your credentials are correct to the database. Double check for typos and make sure the database is running.

## Tips

- The default username for PostgreSQL is `postgres` (`POSTGRES_USER`).
- The most common `DB_HOST` is `localhost`.
- If you installed `PgAdmin`, it should've asked to enter a password during install, you must enter the same password in your .env file.
