# Bat runner file

When using the standalone version you can use this file to start the client and API simultaneously.

1. Create a file called `start.bat` in the `snaily-cadv4` directory.
2. Add the following contents to the file:

```bash
set "client_command=yarn workspace @snailycad/client start"
set "api_command=yarn workspace @snailycad/api generate && yarn workspace @snailycad/api start"


concurrently "%client_command%" "%api_command%"
```
