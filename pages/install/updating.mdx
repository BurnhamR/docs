First, shut down the CAD.
This can be done by pressing `CTRL+C` in the Command Prompt for standalone installations or `docker-compose down` for Docker installations

First we must update our local code:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Secondly, we must update dependencies that might've changes from the last release. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
yarn
```

## Building util packages

```bash
yarn workspace @snailycad/schemas build && yarn workspace @snailycad/config build
```

## Re-building the client

Once the previous command finishes, we must re-build the client's UI:

```bash
yarn workspace @snailycad/client build
```

docker-compose -f production.docker-compose.yml up -d
```
