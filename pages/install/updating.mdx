# Updating SnailyCADv4

This guide explains how to update SnailyCADv4 to a new version.

## Getting started

First, shut down the CAD.
This can be done by pressing `CTRL+C` in the Command Prompt for standalone installations or `docker-compose down` for Docker installations

There are 2 ways of updating SnailyCADv4:

- [Automatically using a simple script](#automatic)
- [Manually](#manual)

### Automatic

  If there are things that need to be updated in the `.env` file. Please update this before running
  the command.

Simply run the command below. This will run all the commands of the manual way.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SnailyCAD/autoupdater/main/dist/index.js > script.js

node script.js
```

### Manual

#### Updating local code

First we must update our local code:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

#### Updating dependencies

Secondly, we must update dependencies that might've changes from the last release. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
yarn
```

#### Building everything

Now we must build all the packages again. *(client, schemas, config, types)*

```bash
yarn turbo run build
```

#### Startng SnailyCAD

To bring the CAD back up run the following command:

##### Docker

```bash
docker-compose -f production.docker-compose.yml up -d
```

##### Standalone

```bash
yarn run concurrently "yarn workspace @snailycad/client start" "yarn workspace @snailycad/api generate && yarn workspace @snailycad/api start"
```
