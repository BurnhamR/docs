# Updating SnailyCADv4

This guide explains how to update SnailyCADv4 to a new version.

## Getting started

First, shut down the CAD by typing `docker-compose down` in the directory where you installed the CAD in a command prompt/terminal and wait for the services to stop.

## Updating local code

First we must update our local code:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

## Re-building the client

Once the previous command finishes, we must re-build the client's UI:

```bash
yarn workspace @snailycad/client build
```

## Starting

To bring the CAD back up run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f production.docker-compose.yml up -d
```
