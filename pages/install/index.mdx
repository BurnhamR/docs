# Installation

## Requirements

All the items listed below are required to get the CAD up and running smoothly.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [npm](https://npmjs.org)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [Docker Desktop](https://docker.com/get-started) (Windows), [Docker](https://docker.com/get-started) (Linux)

## Installing the CAD

Once you've got all the items installed, we can get started with installing SnailyCADv4.

### Getting Started

To get started, open the Command Prompt on Windows or the Terminal on Linux.

### Cloning the GitHub repository

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Warning:</span> do not install the CAD in the root folder.
  Install the CAD in your <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Documents</span>
  folder for Windows or <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>home</span> folder for linux.

To fix this, run the following command:

**Windows**

```bash
cd Documents
```

**Linux**

```bash
cd /home/$(whoami)
```

</Callout>

First we'll need to clone to repo to our own machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnailyCAD/snaily-cadv4.git
```

Once it finishes, we can enter the folder

```bash
cd snaily-cadv4
```

### Installing dependencies

Now we'll install the dependencies that are required to start SnailyCADv4.

```bash
yarn
```

### Docker setup

#### Configration

We'll setup the envrionment variables now, firslty we must copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.

**Windows:**

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

**Linux:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now open the `.env` file and edit it's contents. View more info below.

##### .env info

<Callout emoji="💡">
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Tip:</span> When changing anything in the `.env` file, make
  sure to re-build the client!
</Callout>

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: the password to the postgress database. This password _does not_ exist yet. So enter some random password.
- `POSTGRES_USER`: the username to the postgress database. This user _does not_ exist yet. So enter some random username.
- `DB_HOST`: The database host. **When using docker, keep as is!**
- `DB_PORT`: The port to the databse. **When using docker, keep as is!**
- `POSTGRES_DB`: The database name. **When using docker, keep as is!**
- `DATABASE_URL`: **Do not change unless you know what you're doing!**
- `JWT_SECRET`: This is a random value to keep the CAD secured.
- `CORS_ORIGIN_URL`: This is the URL to your site where the CAD is hosted, eg `https://cad.mysite.com` or `http://99.99.00.190:3000`, or use a wildcard to allow on all sites `*`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_ORIGIN`: The URL/IP to where the API is hosted eg `https://cad-api.mysite.com/v1` or `http://99.99.00.190:8000/v1`. When testing this locally (on `localhost`), keep as is.

#### Docker network

Now we must setup a Docker network so the CAD can communicate with it's services.

```
docker network create cad_web
```

## Building util packages

```bash
yarn workspace @snailycad/schemas build && yarn workspace @snailycad/config build
```

#### Building Client

_Last but not least.._, we must build the client's UI:

```bash
yarn workspace @snailycad/client build
```

### Starting SnailyCADv4

After completing all the steps above, we are ready to startup the CAD. To do this run the following command:

<Callout emoji="💡">
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Tip:</span> When running the command for the fist time, this
  will pull down all services from the Docker Hub. This can take a few minutes.
</Callout>

```bash
docker-compose -f production.docker-compose.yml up -d
```

To stop the CAD, simply type `docker-compose down` in the directory where you installed the CAD in a command prompt/terminal and wait for the services to stop.
