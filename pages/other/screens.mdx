# Running Snailycad with `screen` in Linux

You can run snailycad under a screen so you can safely close the terminal/ssh window without risking it closing out on you!

## Creating a screen

First you need to create the screen do the following:
`screen -S snailycad`
You can change `snailycad` to whatever it's just a name nothing important

after you enter it, it will immediately open a screen session here you can goto your snailycad folder and run:
 
```bash
yarn run concurrently "yarn workspace @snailycad/client start" "yarn workspace @snailycad/api generate && yarn workspace @snailycad/api start"
Afterwards do CTRL A + X (DO NOT CTRL C IT WILL CLOSE THE CAD!)

If you want to reopen that session you can list all the screens using the following command:
`screen -list`

to connect to an existing screen like the snailycad one you created do the following

`screen -r -D snailycad`
again change `snailycad` to your screen name!

And that's it!
