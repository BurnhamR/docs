# FiveM Script integration for SnailyCad!
Need a 911 script for the cad, not to worry we've got you covered!

Downloads:
911: https://rhys19.xyz/downloads/sc_911.zip
Postals: https://rhys19.xyz/downloads/sc_postal.zip

## Setting up the script
First you need to download it and open server.lua

change the following:
`local CAD_API = 'https://api.yourdomain.com' -- CAD API URL/IP` Change this to your domain and change https to whether you have ssl or not!
`local CAD_API_KEY = 'CAD_API_KEY'` this is your api key it's located under Admin -> Cad Settings -> Api Token -> Show
If no token is shown click generate API Token
`local API_NGINX = true -- using nginx reverse proxy?` this is if your using nginx to reverse proxy the API so instead of ip:8080 or domain.com:8080 it's domain.com
`local API_PORT = "8080" -- if not using nginx reverse proxy` this is only for if your not using nginx reverse proxy and you changed the api port otherwise leave at default
Next you need to upload the files to your server!

Then Add to your server.cfg

```
sc_911
sc_postal
```


Restart your server and your done!

The default command is `/call911`

You can change this command under server.lua line 21 where it says `RegisterCommand("call911", function(source, args)` change call911 to any command.
