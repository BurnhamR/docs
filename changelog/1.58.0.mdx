# Release 1.58.0

This release packs some long awaited features and bug fixes.

**Combined Units in active map units list**

Finally, this bug is fixed. You can now see combined units in the active map units list. On the live map, the players are still separated.

**Panic Button icon on live map**

When a unit has enabled their panic button, this will now be shown on the live map with an icon. Thanks to [@Creizy](https://github.com/Creizy) for creating the icon!

**License Points**

Officers can now view and manage a citizen's license points in Name Search. Owners can manage the threshold when the license should be suspended.

:::note
The licenses do not suspend automatically, however, there will be an indication when the license should be suspended.

**Minor Improvements**
