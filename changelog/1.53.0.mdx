# Release 1.53.0

This release includes many improvements to loading data. You'll see some improvements to table loading UI and more bug fixes.
**Please update at your earliest convenience.**

**Improved Table Loading errors**

If there's a loading error, a better error will be displayed instead of multiple toast/popup errors.

**Notifications**

Notifications are being slowly worked on and will be added for more types in the future. Currently there will be a notification badge for any pending DMV/BOF items and admin related pending items.


**Default Permissions**Â¨

"Auto Set User Properties" has been revamped to "Default Permissions". You can now select each permission individually to be granted when a new user registers.

**Force Account Password (optional)**

A new optional feature - when enabled - that will require any user to set a password if they authenticated via Discord or Steam.
