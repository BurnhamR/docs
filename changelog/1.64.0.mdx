This release includes tons of bug fixes and stability improvements.

**Signal 100 Repeat**

Owners\* are now able to set a repeat on the Signal 100. This can be found in CAD-Settings -> Misc Settings -> Bottom of the page ;)

**Assign all units to 911 call**

Dispatch is able to assign all units to a 911 call with a single click. This can be found in the 911 call modal.

**Allow unit with same department and callsign per user (optional feature)**

When this feature is enabled, a user can create multiple units with the same department and callsign. This can be enabled in CAD-Settings -> Features (Disabled by default)

**API Schemas for Swagger**

We've added API schemas for Swagger. This allows you to see the API schemas in Swagger.
