# Release 1.55.0

This release mostly includes new features and bug fixes. Please update at your earliest convenience.

**User defined Combined Units Callsign (Optional Feature)**

When merging into a combined unit, the user can now define the callsign of the combined unit. This feature is disabled by default.

**Hospital Services**

Hospital Services allow users with the correct permissions to manage dead citizens and allow them to become "alive" again. This feature can be disabled.

**Developer Mode**

When in developer mode, you'll be able to view IDs of a few items in the UI. This can be managed at: Account -> Appearance Settings -> Developer Mode

**Fully remove old permissions system**

The old permissions system (`isLeo`, `isDispatch`, etc.) has been removed entirely. This system was outdated and poor. [Read more here](https://github.com/SnailyCAD/snaily-cadv4/pull/1619)
